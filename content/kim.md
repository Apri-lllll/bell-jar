## Chuck McGill

- Jimmy... If what you're saying is true, Jimmy could be charged with forgery, fraud, falsifying evidence, even breaking and entering.
- Frankly I am sick about this, but facts are facts.
- And what is your evidence?
- My evidence, my evidence is knowing my brother for his entire life.
- Chuck I think there's another explanation, it's a simpler one. You made a mistake.
- I did not.
- You're working by lattern light, squinting over 10 point type for hour after hour. Mistakenly changing 1261 to 1216 would be the most natural thing in the world. It could certainly happen to me.
- I did not make a mistake!
- I believe you did.
- Look, I understand you have a great affection for Jimmy, a great many people do, but please open your eyes here!
- You made a mistake, and instead of just facing out to it, you accuse your brother of plotting against you, you come up with this elaborate scheme...
- He's capable of this, you know it!
- I know he's not perfect, and I know he cuts corners, but you're the one who made him this way. He idolizes you, he accepts you, he takes care of you, and all he ever wanted was your love and support. But all you've ever done is judge him. You never believed in him. You never wanted him to succeed. And you know what? I feel sorry for him. And I feel sorry for you.

## Kevin Wachtell

- We owe you the truth. And the truth is, you ignored our advice.
- So this is my fault?
- We said Mesa Verde should reconsider the site for the call center. You declined. We advised you to keep the purchased lot as an investment. You declined. And we advised you to leave that meeting when it became apparent that the other side was negotiating in bad faith. You declined. At every point, we gave you the best guidance we could, and at every point, you chose to go your own way. We are your attorneys, and it is our job to advise you. The decisions will always be your, but... if you continue to ignore us, then this is the wrong relationship. And Kevin, I have to tell you, whoever represents you in the future, I hope you're gonna listen to them a little better.

## Lalo Salamanca

- Are you, are you kidding me with this? Do you know what he did for you? Seven million dollars of your money, he hauled it across a goddamn desert without one penny missing. And he got you out of jail, for a murder that, let's face it, you're definitely guilty of. He did everything you asked, and went way beyond what any other lawyer would ever do, so what exactly is it that you're getting at? What do you want?
- I found his car in a ravine. Bullet holes on the side. So? I'm just waiting to hear how that happened.
- Bullet holes. That's it? Look, I don't know what it's like where you live, but here in New Mexico, you leave a soda can out, someone's taking a shot at it. That, that's what you're on about? You don't think it's possible a couple of yahoos with guns shot up a piece of junk car and then rolled it into a ditch, end of story? What kind of operation are you running, anyway? Tell me. Cause I think I know why you sent him to do this job. It's obvious. You have no one else you can trust. Right? So you sent some... lawyer? Through the desert with your sever million bucks? That's... no offense but, you need to get your house in order.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah really. If you don't trust your men with your money, then you have bigger problems than if you trust Saul Goodman. And for the record, he doesn't lie. Not to me, not to his clients. He's telling you the truth. But next time you have a bunch of money and no one you can trust, leave him out of it. Okay? Try a... wire transfer, try a shell company, or or... you've heard of the Cayman Islands right? Jesus, get your shit together, and stop torturing the one man who went through hell to save your ass.

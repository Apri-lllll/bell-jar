### Chapter 1 - Autumn

Vivaldi's eyes glistened a gold hue. They were the first things you would see if you ever catch him out on the roam at night. It was barely possible to make out the contours of his sleek, dark fur against the velvety cloak of the night that draped down earlier and earlier each day as the seasons progressed.

Vivaldi had always been a mysterious figure in the eyes of the kittens in his neighborhood -- they assumed he was nice, but were afraid to approach him. They each had their own theory on what Vivaldi would do if he wasn't a chess player. Some said magician, others said mathematician, or violinist (duh). In their minds these roles fit his image the best -- eyes darting, tail flicking (his dark tail had a white tip that made it look like snow-capped Mount Fuji), always attentive.

But that night Vivaldi didn't feel like using his brain that much. The sky was clear in Madrid. Bright, starry, a sky only possible in the eyes of the young. He tried to calm his nerves by numbering the stars, but that wasn't quiet enough to block the intrusive thoughts. It had long been rumored that when chess players look up a the sky, they imagined it as a 64-square checked board, where the stars were chess pieces. And when their gaze charted the sky from one end to another, they weren't tracing the constellations, but envisioning arrows, contemplating checks, captures, and attacks.

Only professionals like Vivaldi knew that all those rumors were true. He shook his head in frustration, trying to clear his mind, but that only made it worse. Chess positions from the previous day lived rent-free in his head, spinning, spiraling, sinking him into waves of vertigo.

It was also believed that those looming two-legged creatures that cats called "homos" saw black cats like Vivaldi as a symbols intelligence and fortune. Several times, homos had taken out phones or cameras and aimed them at him as he crossed their path. It was kind of annoying, as if an additional pair of eyes were following him. Vivaldi didn't care about what homos believed -- they seemed to lack general intelligence anyway. He sometimes doubted whether he was "talented" enough, whatever that was supposed to mean, and the baseless superstitions of these disrespectful creeps were unlikely to change that.

As usual, he had Corelli at his side. Corelli was a black-and-white cat that looked round -- round head, round paws, round eyes, a pile of perfect compass-drawn circles of roundness. Seemingly naive but mischievous at heart, he had picked up some skills from always being with Vivaldi. Not anywhere near professional, but enough to blow his friends off the board at the park, and impress them every night at the bar or the library.

Unlike Vivaldi, Corelli was dosing off alright. Vivaldi envied how he never had to endure sleepless nights like himself. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind? He nudged his nose against Corelli's neck. It didn't stir him a bit, and all Vivaldi could feel was Corelli's breathing leading his soft fur closer, farther, then closer again, and the warmth seeping in and enveloping him like the gentle mist of a rainy day. He closed his eyes, but the stars were still darting. He still saw the whole wide sky in his mind's eye.



### Chapter 2 - Winter

The days couldn't get shorter than this, and snow was starting to amass. The occasional noises of furry tails brushing against chess tables at the tournament scene did little to disrupt the lonely stillness of its vicinities -- and similarly, the calm silence of the playing hall during matches was a mere facade for the waters boiling underneath the surface. Vivaldi knew how much was at stake, yet he felt so small and insufficient, a light pencil dot on this endless, unforgiving canvas called nature. But then, perhaps this tournament, and the candidates spot that was on the line that seemed to totally consume him, was nothing more than a splash of ink.

He pulled himself out of his meditations -- this was no time for philosophizing. The cats were playing for the top stop, which would grant them entry to the World Cats' Chess Championship (WCCC). They would play the final round the next day, and the math was simple enough. Vijay, one of the youngest, was a slim and speedy Siamese, and had had an intimidating record following several tough games. He would be playing Hiroki, an overtly confident, seemingly indifferent orange cat. And Vivaldi would be playing Ivan, a chestnut-colored Siberian who always turned heads when he walked by. It was hard to imagine a more fitting ending to the tournament.

This was one of the rare occasions where Corelli accompanied him to a tourney -- he usually stayed back in Madrid. He always stared quietly or paced around while looking at his paws, and unchanging silhouette amid the hub of scrutiny and speculation.

As Vivaldi felt his paw touch Ivan's, he couldn't help but think begrudgingly how this golden ticket had once belonged to both of them. An argument could be made that it merely opened the gates for more grueling days and sleepless nights to come flooding in. And surely they both remembered the unmistakable sense of relief that accompanied disappointment. The feeling of your back against the ground knowing that you could not fall any further. Was it worth another go? At that moment no cat was debating whether the ticket was actually as shiny as it seemed; the attraction they felt was primal, feral even, and it did not matter whether victory was a mirage.

"The most dramatic game of the tournament -- between Vivaldi and Ivan -- finished in a draw, after so many nerve wracking changes of evaluation"

Taking himself out of the picture, it was perfectly cinematic, the perfect storyline with a perfect hero. Sliding past all the kittens crowded around the chess tables to meet Vijay, Vivaldi felt as if he just witnessed the rushed end of a grand feast. What's left was tablecloths stained by pawprints and vases swept off the table and broken into pieces. He felt the curtain closing and the spectators, reluctant to leave but already weary, turn from the stage and make their exits. He wondered if Hiroki and Ivan felt the same. In any way, it was time for him to leave too. The coldest days had already ended, but a few snowflakes still crystallized in the air, taking their wavering, hesitant paths down, down, towards the soil.

Corelli silently watched Vivaldi walk away, his paws crunching down on the pristine sheet of snow, sketching a trail of each step he took. He always had similar feelings witnessing Vivaldi's chess -- the deep calculations he barely followed, and the nearly cruel standards Vivaldi put himself up to he understood but couldn't empathize. To him, the grace of these cats' moves were hardly marred by the inevitable slips. He sometimes asked Vivaldi about the rumors that chess would be solved one day and turn meaningless, but Vivaldi was seldom disturbed. "We're cats, not machines, and that's the whole point." Corelli found himself understanding these words more as time went by. No matter how perfect Vivaldi often seemed to him, deep down they were still alike, both of them still blissfully and beautifully flawed.

As he lifted his head, Vivaldi was already a black dot in the distance. He wasn't sure if he should follow along.



### Chapter 3 - Spring

Spring always came loved and long-awaited. Vivaldi was not superstitious. When it came to tournaments he believed in green tea much more than lucky dates. But even he couldn't help but associate the rising temperature with better luck to come. He mulled over the season's tournament plans as he dipped his paws into the freshly thawed creek, letting the tingling sensation of the chilly water shoot upwards. He relished it -- this fleeting moment of clarity.



### Chapter 4 - Summer

So much, yet so little, had changed.

"Are you a player of chess?" He heard a holler before even entering the park.

And the clanks of chess pieces hitting marble tables, or being knocked onto the ground by some over-excited paws. No posh velvet cushions here -- it's not the WCCC after all.

The chess corner attracted a crowd of its own, drawing together all these cats living in different time zones of life. Kittens mostly took on two extremes, either awfully timid or daringly aggressive. Older ones slanted languidly across the benches and told their stories about how the eldest of them once met the legendary player Mr. Fishy. Pages were turned, lessons taught and learned, stories exchanged and farewells sent. Players of chess, players in life.

Vivaldi had spend many time zones of his own life here in New York.

(a courageous and sprawling stream-of-consciousness)

As he pulled himself out of his mind's wanders through those rainy Brooklyn days that had long gone past, the summer sunlight that rested on his fur only seemed sweeter. He looked around at the unfamiliar faces at the park and thought about the regulars he met when he was a kitten and how it was unlikely that he would ever see them again. But, but even if they could miraculously gather around him right then and there, it would be different, wouldn't it? In the time he had taken to see the world's stages, every cat would have gone through entrances and exits of their own, and become someone entirely different. He couldn't complain. He himself had let the seasons change his mind many times over since then.

"Corelli, " he said, turning around, "Pity you weren't with me yet back then. I was a bit of a loner."

Only upon seeing Corelli's blank face did it occur to him that his musings were all in his head. "Sorry, brain fog again... I must have seemed like a dazed old grinch of a cat just now!"

"Stop saying that Vivaldi, you know I would give anything to have your coat of fur." Corelli had just finished spectating a match, and walked back towards Vivaldi in that always-assured manner of his.

Does reminiscing always feel like this? We visit our memories like retrieving goods from a fire -- they come back dusty and charred, but still we willingly keep them close for a long time to come.

The chess tables formed a perfect circle, and he thought to himself that perhaps every cat always comes back to where they started. He sat down and pawed the pieces and pawns, feeling the ridges of the miniature soldiers etching across his soft flesh, his whiskers vibrating against the summer breeze like violin strings. The cat sitting opposite the table was a regular, one of those players who could never beat a grandmaster, but was also never afraid.

"Chess?"

Vivaldi's voice was ever so slightly above the sound of the jazz band playing somewhere in the distance, and he felt as if the wind was sending the notes straight towards him. It was impossible to escape, but he welcomed it anyway.

They touched paws, and the tick, tick, tick of the chess clock joined in the symphony.



### Epilogue

"Wreowwww----!!!!"

Corelli let out a shrill screech as he clawed aimlessly at thin air. Vivaldi felt slightly pissed to be woken up at this time of day.

"What on earth, Corelli?"

"Oh, wait, ummmm, I had a bad dream... All the cats turned into homos. Except for me."

"Really? What did I look like as a homo?"

"I don't really remember, I think you had curly dark hair and dark glasses."

"So I was the nerdy type?"

"Maybe hehe. You were towering over me and I was scared you all were gonna leave me. But I don't think you did, maybe, ... I sort of forgot about that too."

"Awww cutie..."

"I also remember you were sitting in front of one of those things that homos seemed to spend such a long time with. You were talking to it, I think I even heard some words about me... you called me a handsome boy! Anyway I'm probably hallucinating things... let's not talk about dreams anymore."

So they went back to sleep together.

> WIP. I'm just bored. Found this in my folders and thought it was quite good. Should finish it. Cute first work of fiction?

Vivaldi's eyes glistened a gold hue. They were the first things you would see if you ever catch him out on the roam at night. It was barely possible to make out the contours of his sleek, dark fur against the velvety cloak of the night that draped down earlier and earlier each day as the seasons progressed.

Vivaldi had always been a mysterious figure in the eyes of the kittens in his neighborhood -- they assumed he was nice, but were afraid to approach him. They each had their own theory on what Vivaldi would do if he wasn't a chess player. Some said magician, others said mathematician, or violinist (duh). In their minds these roles fit his image the best -- eyes darting, tail flicking (his dark tail had a white tip that made it look like snow-capped Mount Fuji), always attentive.

But that night Vivaldi didn't feel like using his brain that much. The sky was clear in Madrid. Bright, starry, a sky only possible in the eyes of the young. He tried to calm his nerves by numbering the stars, but that wasn't quiet enough to block the intrusive thoughts. It had long been rumored that when chess players look up a the sky, they imagined it as a 64-square checked board, where the stars were chess pieces. And when their gaze charted the sky from one end to another, they weren't tracing the constellations, but envisioning arrows, contemplating checks, captures, and attacks.

Only professionals like Vivaldi knew that all those rumors were true. He shook his head in frustration, trying to clear his mind, but that only made it worse. Chess positions from the previous day lived rent-free in his head, spinning, spiraling, sinking him into waves of vertigo.

It was also believed that those looming two-legged creatures that cats called "homos" saw black cats like Vivaldi as a symbols intelligence and fortune. Several times, homos had taken out small, rectangular boards and aimed them at him as he crossed their path. It was kind of annoying, as if an additional pair of eyes were following him. Vivaldi didn't care about what homos believed -- they seemed to lack general intelligence anyway. He sometimes doubted whether he was "talented" enough, whatever that was supposed to mean, and the baseless superstitions of these disrespectful creeps were unlikely to change that.

As usual, he had Galileo at his side. Galileo was a black-and-white cat that looked round -- round head, round paws, round eyes, a pile of perfect compass-drawn circles of roundness. Seemingly naive but mischievous at heart, he had picked up some skills from always being with Vivaldi. Not anywhere near professional, but enough to blow his friends off the board at the park, and impress them every night at the bar or the library.

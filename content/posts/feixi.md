Today I thought about how I hadn't thought about Feixi Road for an awfully long time. When I moved to my new campus this year I thought I would miss it often...

So basically Feixi Road is the small road directly to the west of my original campus, and when we said "Feixi" we almost always meant the street food vendors that lined up both sides of it every evening at 10pm. "Feixi" is a flexible term. You could say "吃肥西吗 (wanna eat Feixi)?", "去肥西吗 (wanna go to Feixi)?", or simply "肥西吗 (wanna Feixi)?"

When I was a freshman, a senior student told me about all the ins and outs of Feixi -- which foods were good and which were meh, the differences between different vendors that sold the same stuff, etc etc. For instance, he explained how personal preference regarding the two fried tofu vendors divided the whole school's loyal Feixi-goers the way abortion divided America (okay that last part was me). It felt almost like a welcoming ritual, and soon after that I became a Feixi expert myself ;) There was the time I just finished an exam at night with my roommate, and we both thought we were f\*\*\*ed. I was singing *Motion Sickness*, boba tea in hand, as I headed to Feixi to buy barbecued squid. And the time when I was annoyed and discouraged by how my co-author (who was my senior but also just starting out) never trusted my academic writing. I picked a random direction and walked a mile in the dark before returning to the west gate, and Feixi. That night I had 清补凉, a cold desert from Hainan which consisted of sweets, beans and fruit slices immersed in coconut milk. And the time when my debate team was preparing for a motion on the pros and cons of legalizing moving vendors. After we finished for the night we would declare that we were going on a "field experiment", and go visit the vendors along Feixi Road.

Now you may be wondering, doesn't the phrase "legalize moving vendors" mean that moving vendors, therefore Feixi, were illegal in the first place? Well you're not wrong. Moving vendors have always been stuck in a grey area legally, and most cities have introduced regulations on where and when the vendors are allowed to operate. But you can imagine the debatable effectiveness of their enforcement. At first I heard that there was a WECHAT GROUP with all the vendors and the policemen of the area, where the police would announce in advance the exact time they would come so that the vendors could conveniently avoid them. The group was in place for a couple of years at least before it disintegrated (for reasons that remain unknown to me). Later on the police would just arrive unannounced. Seeing them, the vendors would hop on their motorbikes and zoom away into the deep dark fringes of the winding alleys around Feixi Road, scattering like kids playing dodge ball. A minute later the police would leave nonchalantly and they would all zoom back into place at their usual spots. It was the perfect embodiment of order and chaos in the same picture.

Now it's time to talk about my favorite Feixi foods.

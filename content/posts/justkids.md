I came across a physical copy of this book when I was browsing a bookstore in upper west side Manhattan. I chose it over another of Patti's books because the blurb said that it "starts as a love story and ends as an elegy (to New York)". I enjoyed love stories and loved New York even more, though I had just arrived not long ago. From this aspect, *Just Kids* certainly did not dissapoint. The lives and minds of the artists were interwoven with parts of the city that I was gradually getting to know myself, from the chess hustlers at Washington Square Park to the bustling liveliness of 42nd Street and Sixth Avenue.

Patti wrote in a way that demystified the life of the artist but never took away its romantic, idealistic hue. Patti and Robert's years together were hard and not without the trivial. They had to hustle to provide for each other and keep a place to live, just as many "normal" people were doing in the unforgiving city. The "normalness" of these aspects of their lives almost makes the story even more romantic, and their struggles to survive bore witness to their dedication to art and to each other.

Patti and Robert's art was testament to a love story for the ages, and the way they fused into each other's masterpieces meant that this story was only possible within the lives of two artists. It was heartbreaking, especially towards the end, as Patti witnessed Robert's death. When I read this part of the book, I happened to be obsessed with Lucy Dacus's album *Historian*, and I had just read an interview where Lucy explained why the final track was titled "Historians", but the album title took the singular form. Lucy described a scene where two lovers documented each other's history until one of them bids their farewell, leaving the other with a library of their history. The ending of the memoir, which also marks the ending of their relationship in the physical world, felt devastating in the exact same way. Patti was left with fragments of their relationship -- Robert's photo of her for *Horses* that looked more like him than Patti, her own songs and poems that were surely influenced by Robert. Just as she sings at the end of *Horses*: "but I think it's sad, it's much too sad, that our friends can't be with us today."

Considering the complexities and openness of their relationship, many people tend to see it as a platonic friendship rather than "love" as we usually know it. But call it what you want, it's no less romantic. I normally find myself quite immune to romance, but I couldn't get the image of the two artists holding hands in Times Square on a snowy New Year's Eve out of my mind. I imagined the glaring lights of New York shimmering and vibrating through glistening snowflakes, Patti turning around to look at Robert with her hair flowing in the wind and her eyes glowing just like the falling snow, the city's supercuts reflecting off these pristine moments. While I am aware that I am no Patti Smith, but that revelation doesn't stop me from wanting to find my own Robert Mapplethorpe, and the supposedly platonic, nonetheless true and free, love that this entails.

The memoir references its title early on, when the two just met and didn't yet have a roof over their heads. But I would like to think that even after all the loss that life threw at them, they remained young, raw, wild, and just kids. Patti's later works, in all their candidness and primal beauty, seem to prove me right. This is how I would like to live.

(Editing Lindsay's note: this was written before Taylor released TTPD, so I'm claiming the remark of "I'm not Patti Smith" as my own authentic creation. btw I was pissed at Taylor for using Dylan Thomas instead of Robert. Alright, throw in a couple of the most famous names that graced the Chelsea, and you're suddenly a cultured songwriter, yay!)

The biggest lie you can ever tell yourself is that a stray cat wants to go home with you.

Yes, she's cute, she's got those sad pleading eyes that droop down ever so slightly, she scrunches up her torso like an inchworm as she acts all cute and nice. She rubs her dusty little face along the bottom of your jeans. She rubs it along the walls, the doors, the even-more-dusty motorcycles parked along the road.

Yes, she follows you, albeit quite hesitantly, tracking your next move and always lagging a bit behind. She hides behind the metal door frame and pokes her head out, leaning against it, to look up at you. When you meow at her she meows back and follows you closer.

Yes, she does this every time she sees you. You might have even convinced yourself that she could recognize you and likes you very very specifically.

But if she does not go home with you, then she doesn't want to. She might just want your food, she might just want pets, she might just want to murder you. That's beside the point. But stop telling yourself that she's afraid of the elevator. She doesn't want to go into the elevator. She doesn't want to go home with you. Stop lying to yourself.

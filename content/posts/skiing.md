Listening to Home Video going back to the office
Friends all drowsy with eyelids half shut
The thud, thud, thudding of temples against windows
Tonight's the latest I can put off that email
But I told myself it will all be alright

Fuzzy nests between bare branches
Chemtrails crisscrossing glaring sun rays
Clouds sandwiched within layers of color
Down, down, full speed,
I haven’t learned how to control the skis

The air was warm yet my fingers trembled
As I saw your good news light up the screen
The dots on the clock flickered once per second
As we crawled inch by inch towards the dusk of the day
I’m gonna miss you at the end of it all

Racing against the bus through hopeless traffic
Never noticed the early dark nights and frozen ears
It’s hard to allow myself to feel lonely
“Don’t let the wicked city get you down”

Repeating steel rods, metal lumps, smoking chimneys
A city that seemed to be made of dust and endless cold
Maybe I’ve always took you a little too seriously
But anyway, don’t keep yourself up because of me

I thought the turquoise tinted windshield was the color of the sky
And the tumbling sun-sketched steam puffs were clouds in distress
And that bouncing leaf in my periphery was a racing hound
And the yellow and white lighted windows were the city’s million eyes
Reality wasn’t a picture book
But it was good enough for me
All this time

> I wrote the first draft of this half a year ago, on my way back from skiing. Just decided to polish things up and stash it here. Always touching to read things in hindsight. I love you all.

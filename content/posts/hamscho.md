When I first got obsessed with *Hamilton*, I sometimes cried to lines like "I will never be satisfied" (*Satisfied*) or "In their eyes I see you Alexander, I see you every time" (*Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story*). I still do, but today was the first time I paid due notice to an unassuming line in *Take a Break*, why it is deeply and vastly sad, and how it strings together the tragic side of Hamilton's life experiences.

> They think me Macbeth, and ambition is my folly

Below is a the context in the song:

> My dearest Angelica
> Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
> Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
> I trust you'll understand the reference to
> Another Scottish tragedy without me having to name the play
> They think me Macbeth, and ambition is my folly
> I'm a polymath a pain in the ass a massive pain
> Madison is Banquo, Jefferson's Macduff
> And Birnam Woods is Congress on its way to Dunsinane

When put into context, "they think me Macbeth" obviously alludes to a common superstition in the world of theater, that saying the word "Macbeth" on stage brings misfortune to the actors. Hamilton originally wanted to avoid saying the word by only dropping Angelica a hint, but then goes ahead and says it anyway. Of course, in reality Hamilton was sitting in his study instead of standing on a stage, but breaking fourth walls isn't the main point of this essay so I won't go into it ;)

The misfortune associated with "Macbeth", in all its evasiveness and volatility, brings me to Hamilton's fate, which I believe is the most important thing he fought against throughout the whole musical, which means his whole life. There have been many antagonists in Hamilton's dramatic life story, from those who have beliefs to those who have none. He took everything on with relentless determination -- putting it in his own words, he wrote his way out of a storm, out of his remote Caribbean islands, out of hell and into the heart of revolution and the new nation it promised. But there were always tides that couldn't be turned, and fate that he couldn't conquer. Nothing within his power could have guaranteed him the legacy he yearned for or reliably safeguarded him from any downfall. As Washington tried to teach him, "you have no control, who lives, who dies, who tells your story".

If "they think me Macbeth" refers to all the external factors that puppeted Hamilton, "ambition is my folly" more directly turns to his own inner demons. Throughout his life, Hamilton has been propelled forward, "nonstop", by his ambitions. This gave him all of his fame and accomplishments, but also gravely accelerated the death of his son and eventually himself. A sentence in Chernow's original biography beautifully portrays how Hamilton's desires were the unchanging and unstoppable forces throughout his life. “Hamilton was laid to rest with full honors in a martial style that would have gratified the most florid fantasies of the adolescent clerk on St Croix who had once prayed for a war to prove his valor.” Indeed, he was a man who would willingly risk his own life if it meant dying a nobel death. This chronic pursuit of nobelness was perhaps due to his humble beginnings leading to him wanting to earn a legacy through his own endeavors, and Eliza's repeated assurances of "we could be enough" wasn't nearly enough to put out that fire.

One can say that Hamilton's ambition was rooted in his fate, and therefore was part of his fate. I don't know whether Hamilton wanted to "want" so much, or whether he ever felt helplessly controlled by his own self. In a way, Hamilton himself brought about his numerous downfalls and final demise, and what's more tragic than this is that even so, there was nothing else he could have done, since there was no other self to live in. As Schopenhauer said, regarding free will, "a man can do what he wants, but he cannot want what he wants". We do not get to choose ourselves, our audacious ambitions and fatal flaws, as much as we don't get to choose what anyone else is like. Life gives these to us and takes pieces of them away, and the great difficulty is to say Yes to life.

(The ending is a crude play on James Baldwin's *Giovanni's Room*, which is so painfully hard to write about. Maybe I will get to it sometime in the future, or maybe not.)

Hello~ It's me~ I got bored coding once more so I picked the blog up from the dust~

Ummm soooo... For the life update, I simply need to say that I recently passed three rounds of applications and interviews and decided to continue working in my current research group for my Ph.D.

As for myself, I have been slightly more aggressive and slightly more ambitious since first joining my current group. A couple weeks ago I confidently added 50 or so comments to my co-author's completed manuscript and sent it back to him without much hesitation, and I joked to my friend that everyone grows no matter how trash they are. It was true that the improvement was evident. I would not have dared do the same thing a year ago, and it would have caused me much childish torment. As for being ambitious, I think everyone who comes do a Ph.D. at my school wants to do something big, otherwise there are too many easier options open for this path to make any degree of sense. I still don't fully understand how some of my seniors work so efficiently and deal with pressure so well... but I have my own way of going about things and making them work, or else I wouldn't have been able to get here.

(On another note, it is worth celebrating how not a single one of the steps towards getting this Ph.D. spot went too wrong. These things are hard to come across. I've always said that I am lucky concerning people, and unlucky concerning "things", always giving more than I get, and having the guts to continue mostly because of the people I've met along the way. Let's hope this lucky episode is the beginning of the end of this curse.)

My mom recently told me that, during all the back-and-forth to get me this spot, my head teacher lamented to her that I was going too far, that such as top group at the single best uni would cause me too much pressure since I was no natural. "I know her, she's a very hardworking student", she said, hinting at my lackluster academics. But my recent mantra has been to never question whether I deserve something, only whether I want it, since a host of other people already have it as part of their jobs to judge whether I deserve every opportunity that I get. I've found that it's much harder to believe this genuinely than to merely act accordingly, but fortunately enough it only takes the latter to disregard my teacher's suggestions. I have had my share of acquaintances that fully expected me to not succeed, but the good thing is that none of them were particularly important. On the other hand, many of the best people I have ever known about have continued believing in me, and I trust them too much to not believe in their belief for me.

As part of my big plan to do some big things, I think I need to push myself harder to do more general learning and improvement, outside of the daily hamster wheel of unrelenting deadlines. So I will try to write something every week about what I learned that week. No time to write detailed plans yet since I need to rush back onto my hamster wheel, but I figure my twitter bookmarks and github stars are a decent enough place to start.

ps. No one will read this, which means he won't read this, but... To my mentor & friend: As the single best person I have ever met, you have single-handedly changed my life and will certainly continue changing it for the next six years at least. I think you deserve to get everything you've ever wanted (too bad I'm not some kind of goddess, well... c'est la vie ig.) Part of my plans for my coming Ph.D. is to observe you meticulously. For real.

pps. I do feel change coming my way. I do feel ungrounded courage of my convictions for the first time in so many years.

> Love is such a priceless treasure that you can buy the whole world with it, and redeem not only your own but other people's sins. Go, and do not be afraid.

Go, and do not be afraid.

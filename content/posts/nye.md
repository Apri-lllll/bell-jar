Today I read 4000 words of writing I did just a couple months earlier. I didn't remember a thing, and found it both cringy and genius at the same time. I couldn't even begin to imagine how I wrote it and what state of mind I had to be in to write like that. It's strange how a very simple fact can change me in a way that I, for several months on end, couldn't bring myself to do through my own will. And just like that, that piece of writing now belongs to a place I can no longer return to.

Today at the plaza I saw a girl with a couple pieces of fake snow on her hair. She looked real pretty as she held on to her boyfriend's arm. Machines hummed and bands roared and crowds buzzed. Only minutes ago I was complaining about how I had no Christmas or New Year's Eve celebrations and didn't even know how to. Hearing sounds of people only made it worse. It was like they were spoon-feeding me ways to have fun, but I still couldn't bring myself to do it.

Today at the bread store my mother asked me what I wanted to eat and I didn't know. I was tired of being indecisive. I was also tired of forcing a decision out of my mouth so my mother wouldn't be mad at me for being indecisive. Maybe I'm just ungrateful or maybe I often don't get what I want. Maybe I've been constantly choosing between wanting something I could never get and not knowing what I want in the first place. I do wonder which is the lesser evil. What do I actually want?

I want zebra crossings to actually make the cars stop. I want to know why I suddenly get happy or sad. I want to actually have a room of my own. I want to get someone to hate me and feel the relief. I want *Stay Soft* to hurt less. I want my chrome to stop crashing. I want to always think of the best retort. I want deadlines to feel palpable earlier on. I want to understand Sylvia Plath when she talks about those *nine black alps*. I want the noise to dim down but not disappear. 

Happy New Year.

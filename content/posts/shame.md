2024-03-05

The date I wrote down for this post is the day I created the file and wrote everything other than this first section. It was unfinished and I planned to get back to writing some other day. But I never did and no longer intend to because it has been a long time since I've felt shame (is a month long? possibly?). All is well. I received two more rejections and no acceptances or interviews. But all is well.

>It was awful, he cried, awful, awful!

> Still, the sun was hot. Still, one got over things. Still, life had a way of adding day to day.

This is a piece of writing about shame.

Today I received my first graduate program rejection and I felt shame. Shame is a very distinct emotion. It's hard to find any other emotion that is so painfully debilitating but utterly useless at the same time. A philosopher whose name I can't remember once distinguished between shame and guilt and identified guilt, which hinges on recognizing the consequences of one's actions, as the more productive emotion, whereas shame, being fundamentally related to maintaining an image of oneself, is not as conducive to good actions.

Shame makes me want to be mean to people and/or push them away. I would want to be mean to people because I want to stop appearing like I am good and nice, and once they start hating me they would have no more expectations that I am scared of breaking, and once I stop being scared of their expectations I am set free. Just like what Boygenius said in their song *Not Strong Enough*:

>I don't know why I am the way I am
>
>Not strong enough to be your man
>
>I lied, I am just lowering your expectations
>
>Half the mind that keeps the other second guessing
>
>Close your eyes and count

But that solution sucks because I am too often too scared to be mean.

The other solution is to cut ties and push them away. Or even better just ghost them, stop talking, stop responding. Of course I am worried that they will be worried, but as long as I don't do nothing myself, there's not much to think about and mull over either. Not how to answer their "how are you"s (with honesty or with politeness?), not how to explain myself without getting them worried, not whether to disclose my failures and make myself subject to sympathy.

To deal with shame, I like to be silently cynical towards other people. I like to put myself in a position higher up on the "shame chain", to feel capable of silently shaming others the way I imagine people higher than me would shame me.

I guess that in one's childhood shame is not entirely useless, and that's precisely why I have always been systematically trained to feel shame and to succumb to it.

I also should admit that it has been more than half a year since I started pretending that my stuffed animal was a person every single night. I try not to seem lonely but I am. Yet it's not worth the anxiety to be vulnerable to a person who would judge me, and not worth the effort to convince myself that there exists someone out there who wouldn't.

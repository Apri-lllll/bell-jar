I literally host this website on a special github account that no one knows about, so I need to keep being mysterious... But here are some fun things about me:

- I start sentences with "but".
- My mother owned a children's bookstore when I was young.
- My favorite book is *The Bell Jar* (obviously), and I never had a favorite book before that.
- Teleportation is the best superpower.
- If I could get the answer to a single question, it would be: "Am I someone who needs success to be happy?"

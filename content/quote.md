Such a youth, I say, would have steered clear of what happened to my youth, but in certain instances it is, undeniably, more worthy of respect to give oneself up to an enthusiasm, even though it be an irrational one, which none the less proceeds from a great love, than not to give oneself up to it at all. And in one's young years all the more so, for a youth who is always reasonable is not to be relied upon and too cheap is his price - that is my opinion!

--*The Brothers Karamazov*, Dostoyevsky

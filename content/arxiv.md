An important but (sadly) rarely accessible hobby of mine is waiting a long time before rereading something I once wrote. It's like playing lost-and-found with headspaces that could easily get lost in time. This constantly-updated page keeps record of every writing snippet that made me think: "I once wrote THAT?" Many of these are from writings that I never finished and no longer intend to... so this page is also kinda like an orphanage for my writings lol. If and when I finish any of these and add the final version to my posts, I might take them down.
I anticipate this to become very, very, very long.

(Editor Lindsay: This is work in progress. I wish to forget the best part of this poem so I can experience it again, but I couldn't. So I might as well finish this thing up once and for all.)
I didn't need to keep myself awake anymore
So I closed my eyes once again
Maybe I've always took you a little too seriously
But anyways don't keep yourself up for me

### untitled
(Editor Lindsay: I no longer understand what I meant, nor do I want to admit I wrote this.)
Freedom is nothing but
The distance between a hunter and its prey
What about the distance between us?
Is it how far I've come or how deep I've fallen?
I savored all my internal monologues
Loneliness was a blessing til I fell in love
My longing burnt a hole in the sky
It was a vibrant lust you couldn't return

### The Eternal Sunshine of Lucy Dacus's *Home Video*
The most prominent feeling I got from listening to *Home Video* over and over again was an aching sensation. Aching for understanding, aching for love, aching for a resolution to confusion.  Aching to grow up quicker, then aching to be a child again. Nothing sharply painful. But there was always this pang of wistful nostalgia that made you overthink your life and sink into a silent and slight sadness.

### Average Centipaw Loss
Vivaldi's eyes glistened a gold hue. They were the first things you would see if you ever catch him out on the roam at night. It was barely possible to make out the contours of his sleek, dark fur against the cloak of the night that draped down earlier and earlier each day as the seasons progressed.

### Chapter 2 - Invisible String
Somehow I felt the warmth and security of orange cats and crackling fireplaces, along with the sort of nervous apprehensiveness of telling lies, all at once. Sometimes I would even feel the beat of my own heart without having to touch my chest. My heartbeat never raced, but it would become more defiant and articulate than before, like a steady bass drum. And at the end of it all, his fleeting presence made my permanent loneliness even more poignant.
